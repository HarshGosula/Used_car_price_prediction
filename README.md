## Project Overview
The **Car Price Prediction** project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as the car brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine capacity, fuel type, and more. 

Three models were implemented and compared: **XGBoost Regressor**, **Random Forest Regressor**, and **Linear Regression**. The objective is to identify the model that provides the most accurate price predictions, evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Adjusted RÂ² Score. 

The project will help potential car buyers and sellers determine appropriate pricing for used cars, enhancing the decision-making process with data-driven insights.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Car Brand:** Manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Ford)
- **Model:** Specific model and version of the car
- **Year:** Year the car was manufactured
- **Mileage:** Distance traveled by the car (in kilometers or miles)
- **Engine Capacity:** Engine size in cubic centimeters (cc)
- **Fuel Type:** Type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel)
- **Transmission:** Whether the car has a manual or automatic transmission
- **Previous Owners:** Number of previous owners of the car

 The dataset is publicly available and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction).
